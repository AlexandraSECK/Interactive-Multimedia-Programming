    <p><span>Answer 3:</span> Em is relative to the size of the font. Use em permits to have margins proportional to the size of the font and more adapted to the device (size).<br/></p>
    <p><span>Question 4:</span> Article is already 7 years old, do we have any new technology which can be used to achieve same type of UI responsiveness as described in the article. Buzz words: (CSS Grid, Flexbox)<br/></p>
    <p><span> Answer 4: </span>  Since 2009 it's possible to use Flexbox. It is usefull for responsive design because heights and the widths are flexible, it's possible to aligned elements or choose the space beetween elements. It helps to adapted the site to the size of the screen and it uses less code.
      CSS grid permits to choose the order of the elements and to create a grid adapted to the space and so the size of the screen. The user can create a structure for their website and make it responsive easlily.<br/>

    <h2> 2. RWD examples </h2>
    <p>The screenshots of responsive websites can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/AlexandraSECK/Interactive-Multimedia-Programming/tree/screenshots/imglab2">Images Git</a><br/></p>
    <h2> 3. RWD in practice </h2>
    <p><span>Question: </span> How could you prevent user zooming the site on mobile?<br/></p>
    <p><span>Answer: </span> It's possible to use this : <br/>
      <span>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="max_width=480,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" &gt; <br/></span>
      It will prevent the user zooming because of the maximum scale that is equal to the initial scale. It seems to work only on mobile.
    <h2> 4. Adding stuff </h2>

      elements?<br/>
